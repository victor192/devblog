### Week 1

When I first started in this program, I hoenslty was a little scared. I had next to no coding experience and while I knew basically what the MacOS terminal, Visual Studio, and GitHub were used for, I never personally did anyhting within these applications by myself. But the team and the professors made it very easy to understand and i found myself getting the ahng of things after a very short while.

The first week started off with now large startup companies and thier origins, and how a truly simple idea can grow to affect so many lives. Then we learned about CallusCompany's own startup and how they help poeopel with ememroy diseases such as dementia to recognize thier disease or loss of fucnction earlier. This is the aspect that got me interseted in this program. I want to study nueroscience and become a nerve surgeon in the future and this provided me with a different perspective of treatement. Obviosuly things like dementia can be found out through the lab or in a hospital, but a simple app with a handful of puzzles can lead a person to the conclusion that they might have a brain disease is somethign i had not thought about.

It was cerntialy unexpected for the people at CallusCompany, who thought that thier apps main player base would be younger in age. However hrough looking at data collected by the app, they found out that the player base was mostly 50-60 year old women. These peoplpe also left reviews that it helpd them strenghten thier own memeory and even helped them i dentity that thier memeory was deterioating.

But before i got to delveoping and desigiung a game, i would have to see an example of a good puzzle.

I started a report on this puzzle called Pattern in the website and a nonogram in other places (You can find my report in a previous post). This and many other puzzles in that list made me realize a couple key points

- A good game is simple, there shouldnt be too much distracting the player

- Having a small amoutn and good colors that compliemnt each other can go a long way.

- Challenging puzzles make the player want to solve it even more, but there needs to be a balance between fun difficulty and i dont get whats going on difficulty.

- I judged a lot of the games based on what the icon looked like and picked the one that *looked* fun, so an appealing icon is importnat.

And this basically conluded my first week

### Week 2

The next sessiosn were all about UI and UX. I go more in depth in the another post, Learning about User Experience. But when designing these charts and interfaces, I always thought of what the plyaer or customer would think. If you are the one desiging the game, obviosuly, you know exactly whats going on. So even the ommisison of a little detail may seem inconsequential to you, but to a random player it can really confuse them. Assumptions that the player would know somethign would destroy the user experience. Games should really be as simple and intuitive as possible. 

This week is where I started to devleop ideas for a game that enforces brain and memory activity. Throughout the brainstorming, I had to think about if I was playing this would this game be too hard, or too easy. I also thought about how to make the game look fun and keep players still interseted in the game after playing it many times. It was really tough to come up with ideas for a good game.

### Week 3

This was my favroite week out of all of them. Here we both designed the icon for the game and also how it would look while you were palying it. I noticed that my ideas were getting better (to me at least), and i felt more satisfied with what i was desinging and creating
