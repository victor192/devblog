#### Designing an Icon

Towards the end of week 3, we designed a icon for the game "시장에 가면." Designing a good icon generally takes 4 key things to look at. The icon should be as simple as possible, too complex would make it hard to understand what the app is. There should be a metaphor, a symbol that stands for something in the game so you can recognize it. The icon should be as simple as possible, making it easier to see. There should be some connection to the actual game that it is representing. And the last thing is lineage, icons should be recognizable or grouped with other icons easily, and the design should not change drastically every change.

My first draft is shown in figure 1. I eventually went with a golden shopping cart, the same design as in the game, so that it was familiar to the players. This however was only my first draft

Next we learned about the icon grid. Most apps in IOS follow this grid as it makes the icons appear clean and consistent. This can help to identify apps or help them pop out. As shown in the figure, the icon was made in the grid and was placed into the IOS home screen. This is to see if the design is easy to see and stands out from the other apps.

Next it was our turn! I liked my design with the cart in the middle but as one of the teachers pointed out, there was no real connection that it was a game centered around memory. So I added a brain as kind of a logo for the cart (figure 3)

My logo in these next figures are pasted into the IOS platform, CallusCompany's app, and other icons that follow the same theme.

#### Designing the visuals

This first figure gives you an idea on how we developed the appearance of the app in the figma board. It's alot of experimenting on what works and what doesn't. I found myself constantly changing colors or orientations, then sitting back and seeing if it was easy to understand.

One important thing I had to keep in mind while I was designing was making sure the icons were consistent. Even though a small thing like a border on an image or a color difference may make the player have an unpleasant time playing it. It is better to check over to make sure all the icons and visuals are consistent with each other in order to make things look more clean and presentable. Another very important variable was the color and the shape of the items. We needed to pick the right colors in order to make the items as recognizable as possible. This is essential for the purpose of our game, which is identifying objects. If a player has trouble understanding what a particular item is, it would make for a poor playing experience.

This is the finished design for the two screens shown during the game.

After we finished designing the visuals for the app, we needed to make a tutorial and a rulebook for the game. The rulebook has a different function than the tutorial. The game developer uses the rulebook to actually design the game. Thus all wanted or included features must be added to the rulebook. The tutorial however is much more vague and withholding of information. For example, traps or time limits may not be included in the tutorial, and leave players to figure out what is going on.

As you can see from this small section of the summary, the rulebook goes in alot more depth and description of the game than the tutorial does.

During this week I enjoyed making these icons and designing the game's layout. I used to play a lot of mobile games or puzzle games and I now appreciate the work that needs to go into it. Something as simple as an icon can really be a complex visual to plan out, and the smallest of factors can affect how the finished product is viewed.
