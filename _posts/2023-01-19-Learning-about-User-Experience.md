### What is UX (User Experience)?

User Experience is the experience of the person who is using a product and how they feel when they use it. User experience can be hightened by making the app easier to use, including pleasing visuals or colors, and making the application intuitive and straightforward.

### Wireframe/IA/UI Planning

#### IA

An IA is a flow chart that shows the paths a person might take while navigating through an application. Below is a example of a flowchart for the Starbucks app. The chart shows the possible buttons or redirects that the app can take you to. This is important for developing a good user experience as shortcuts or how to easily find certain parts in the application can be planned and mapped out. A IA flowchart can also help the UI developer design the interface.

I then practiced making an IA flowchart for YouTube's mobile app, then CallusCompany's own app (Figures 2 and 3). We used the tool figma to create the IA. It took a while to get the controls and how to create the arrows and boxes but most of it was very intuitive.

#### Wireframe

The next part was developing the wireframe. The wireframe is the unpolished version of what the actual interface is going to look like. This can help developers see what size and where to put ceratin buttons for ease of use and navigation.

#### Designing Interface

Then we developed a rough idea of what the actual wireframe would look like in the app. We also added new features that we though could make the app easier and more fun to use.

### Creating a Game

In the first couple of lessons we brainstormed ideas for a game that could be implemented in to the app, shown in figure 6.

Towards the end of the lessons, we thought of ideas for the different aspects of the games (Figure 8), such as color or sound design. For colors we decided on utilizing the 6 key cooras that the CallusCompany app uses for thier games. For the sound design, when a correct option is selected a coin sound is played, emulating money or change being used. When a wrong option is selected, crying sounds will be played, as the audience (mostly middle aged) would likey have a strong reaction to that sound. We also thought of ideas on how to icnrease the level amount so that players could play the game for longer. Finally we decided on a name for the game, 시장에 가면 for the korean players and (Grandma's) Shopping List.
