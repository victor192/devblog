## Introduction

---

The concept of reserve has been put forward to account for individual differences in
susceptibility to age-related brain changes and pathologic changes such as those that occur
in Alzheimer's disease. Reserve can act as a moderator between pathology and clinical
outcome, thus accounting for this discontinuity. One convenient, although somewhat
artificial, differential classification of reserve is brain reserve versus CR.

## Neuroimaging Studies of Cognitive Reserve

---

The epidemiologic studies suggest that at any given level of clinical AD severity an individual with a higher level of CR should have greater AD pathology. This idea is
illustrated in figure 2. We tested this idea using resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a surrogate for AD pathology30, 31. In AD patients matched for clinical severity, we found an inverse relationship between resting rCBF and years of education32.

## Application Of Cognitive Reserve In Clinical Practice

Integration of the most appropriate and valid measure of CR into the diagnostic formulation
is critical. Individuals with high reserve, by definition, will not demonstrate disease-related
clinical symptoms as early as individuals with low levels of reserve. This issue might
partially be addressed with instrumentation, such that: 1) more challenging tests with higher ceilings may better detect changes in individuals with very high levels of functioning, 2) tests that are more pathologically-specific (e.g., associative learning tasks for the hippocampus) may have greater sensitivity in high reserve individuals. However, clinicians must be aware that in the presence of pathology there should still be a period of time during which even the most sensitive measures would fail to detect cognitive change 

## Conclusion

The concept of CR first emerged from epidemiologic observations. While epidemiologic studies can only describe correlations and do not directly test causation, they are useful for deriving hypotheses and exploring ideas. A wealth of epidemiologic studies suggest that an
array of life exposures seem to be associated with a reserve against age or AD-related
pathology. While the original observations concern easily measurable variables like

education or occupational attainment, more recent studies have delved more deeply into
lifestyle factors, cognitively stimulating behaviors, personality factors and the like. In the
aggregate, they suggest that contributions to reserve come from multiple sources, and that
reserve is not a fixed entity but can change across the lifespan depending on exposures and
behaviors. This is a hopeful idea, since it suggests that changes in lifestyle even later in life might impart reserve against age-related cognitive decline or dementia. Despite this exciting possibility, carefully controlled studies will be required in order to translate this idea into a practical intervention. Such studies would yield practical information both about the combination and timing of activities that may lead to more successful aging
